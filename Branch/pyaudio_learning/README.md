# PyAudio Learning Path

Welcome to your PyAudio learning journey! This directory contains a structured set of examples and exercises to help you learn and understand how to work with audio in Python using the PyAudio library.

## How to Use This Learning Path

1. Start with folder `01_basics` and work your way through the numbered folders
2. Each folder contains two main files:
   - `xx_xxx_concepts.py`: Theory and explanations
   - `xx_xxx_practice.py`: Hands-on exercises to apply what you've learned
3. Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running examples:
   ```
   source ../.venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Start by running the main navigation file:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Or run individual files directly:
   ```
   python 01_basics/01_basics_concepts.py
   ```

## Learning Approach

This course follows a "learn by doing" approach:

1. **Concepts Files**: Each module has a concepts file that explains the theory and key ideas
2. **Practice Files**: Each module has a practice file with exercises that let you write code
3. **Exercises**: The practice files contain exercises with instructions and code templates
4. **Solutions**: Solutions are included as commented code that you can reveal when needed

This approach ensures you understand the concepts and get hands-on experience implementing them.

## Directory Structure

- **01_basics**: Understanding PyAudio fundamentals and concepts
- **02_recording**: Recording audio from microphones and devices
- **03_playback**: Playing audio files and streams
- **04_audio_processing**: Working with audio data and processing
- **05_advanced**: Advanced topics like real-time processing and callbacks
- **06_challenges**: Fun challenges to test your skills

## Requirements

All examples require the PyAudio library that we've already installed in your virtual environment.

Happy learning!
