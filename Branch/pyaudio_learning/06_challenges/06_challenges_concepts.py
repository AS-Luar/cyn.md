# SECTION 1: Voice-Activated Recording
# --------------------------------------------------

'''
CONCEPT: Voice-Activated Recording

Voice-activated recording systems detect when someone starts speaking and
automatically begin recording. This is useful for voice assistants, dictation
software, and hands-free recording applications.

Key concepts:
1. Audio level detection to identify speech
2. Managing recording state (idle, listening, recording)
3. Automatic timeout after prolonged silence
4. Efficient audio buffering

For Challenge 1 in the practice file, you'll implement a voice-activated recorder.

# SECTION 2: Audio Format Conversion
# --------------------------------------------------

'''
CONCEPT: Audio Format Conversion

Audio format conversion involves transforming audio files between different
formats, sample rates, bit depths, and channel configurations. This is essential
for compatibility with different systems and optimizing for specific use cases.

Key concepts:
1. Sample rate conversion (resampling)
2. Bit depth conversion
3. Channel conversion (mono/stereo)
4. Encoding and decoding

For Challenge 2 in the practice file, you'll implement an audio format converter.

# SECTION 3: Audio Visualization
# --------------------------------------------------

'''
CONCEPT: Audio Visualization

Audio visualization converts audio data into visual representations, making
sound "visible" to users. Visualizations help users understand audio levels,
frequency content, and patterns in the sound.

Key concepts:
1. Time-domain visualization (waveforms, volume meters)
2. Frequency-domain visualization (spectrograms)
3. Real-time display techniques
4. Visual design for effective communication

For Challenge 3 in the practice file, you'll implement an audio visualizer.

# SECTION 4: Interactive Audio Playground
# --------------------------------------------------

'''
CONCEPT: Interactive Audio Playground

An interactive audio playground lets users experiment with sound in real-time,
creating engaging and educational audio experiences. These systems combine
user input with audio synthesis or processing.

Key concepts:
1. User input mapping to audio parameters
2. Real-time synthesis and processing
3. Interactive control patterns
4. User experience design

For Challenge 4 in the practice file, you'll implement an interactive audio playground.
