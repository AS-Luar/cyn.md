    "- **Raw audio** may contain noise, silence, or irrelevant frequencies that confuse the recognizer.\n",
    "- **Preprocessed audio** is cleaner, with only the important speech content at the right loudness and frequency range.\n",
    "- **Recognition accuracy**: Preprocessing can significantly increase the percentage of correctly recognized words, especially in challenging environments.\n",
    "- **Practical tip**: Always compare recognition results before and after preprocessing to see the improvement for your specific use case."

    "### Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Out of memory errors**: When processing long audio files, try processing in chunks\n",
    "2. **Distortion after preprocessing**: Ensure normalization doesn't clip audio and filter settings are appropriate\n",
    "3. **VAD removing speech**: Try lower aggressiveness values (0-1 instead of 2-3)\n",
    "4. **Noise reduction artifacts**: Use non-stationary mode for varying noise conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For real-time applications**: Skip intensive steps like noise reduction\n",
    "2. **For batch processing**: Use all preprocessing steps for maximum accuracy\n",
    "3. **For VAD**: Frame duration of 10-30ms works best for typical speech\n",
    "4. **For noise reduction**: Providing a separate noise profile when possible improves results"

    "In the practice guide, you'll build a complete preprocessing pipeline and test it with real audio. You'll compare recognition results before and after preprocessing to see how each technique improves accuracy. The final exercise will integrate everything into a reusable audio processing module that you can use in your voice assistant project."
